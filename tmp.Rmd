I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1


Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r, echo=TRUE ,eval = true, message= TRUE}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.


# Section 3

This is going to make a plot using `ggplot`
```{r}
sample_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000),
  y = x + 1
)



```

# Prcatice 

```{r}
adata = data.frame(variable = rnorm(500,mean = 1))
adata$bool = adata > 0
adata$abs = abs(adata$variable)

hist(adata$abs)


```

meadian value is `r round(median(adata$abs),2)`


# Prcatice Answer
## Sbusection

```{r}
la_df = tibble(
  norm = rnorm(1000,mean = 1),
  logical = norm > 0,
  abs = abs(norm)
)

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs)) + geom_histogram()

```

meadian value is `r round(median(adata$abs),2)`
